- Is ATP6/16S in the gpal/gros assemblies? (ATP6 should be there)
- are pseudogenes really pseudogenes? (might have been tagged as such by ncbi because fishy startcodon)
- Make plots separately for each species (within blast)
	- GC (window of 10)
	- coverage pallida (each population)
	- coverage rostochiensis 
- Make plots for both species (between blast)
	- GC (window of 10)
	- coverage pallida (each population)
	- coverage rostochiensis 
- GC (window of 10)
- Coverage from reads (all vs all)
